# HeartBeat

### Our Project

Every year, in Italy, over 50,000 people are victims of sudden cardiac arrest.
According to [ISTAT](https://www.istat.it/en/archivio/199355), the most frequent causes of death in Italy include ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and other heart diseases. 

_Defibrillating within 3-5 minutes of the onset of cardiac arrest can lead to survival by up to 50-70%.
But if no one intervenes, their chances of survival drop 10-12% for every minute that passes._

In the event of a **cardiac arrest**, early intervention by people present on site, through the first resuscitation maneuvers and the use of semi-automatic defibrillators, can be decisive for the patient's survival.

The project **HeartBeat** aims at facilitating rapid defibrillation from publicly available **Automated External Defibrillators (AED)**, through the creation of a system with the following characteristics:
 
1. Register of defibrillators present in the territory
2. Integration with the 118 Emergency Communications Center
3. Register of the BLSD trained individuals in the region
4. Web portal
5. HeartBeat Mobile App
